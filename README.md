## Intro to Git Version Control
Git is open-source version control software. Using Git, you can create local and remote (cloud) repositories for
your files. Git will allow you to track and label updates to those files (kind of like Google Drive) with comments so
you know what you’ve done. You can also use Git (and interfaces like GitHub) to contribute to other people’s code
and/or allow other people to modify your code.

## How are We Going to Use It?
Basically, I’ll maintain the code archive. I encourage you to use my code and, as you make changes you think
should be implemented for the group, it would be helpful if you would push them back to me. Below, I’ve
highlighted two example workflows by which we can make this work.
